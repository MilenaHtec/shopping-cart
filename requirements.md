# Project Requirements

Build a simple backend API for managing a shopping cart. The cart will include CRUD operations for managing the cart, calculating the total amount, checking out, and handling the cart's lifecycle (add, update, remove, clear).

The cart keeps track of the products, their quantities, and calculates the total price.

The data will be stored in an in-memory database, with essential error handling, logging, and basic unit tests will verify the functionality.

## Functionalities

### Shopping Cart API

- Add, update, and remove shopping cart items.
- Retrieve current cart contents.

## Non-functional Requirements

- Log all major activities.
- Implement unit tests for the cart operations.
- Implement error handling.

## Technical Constraints

- Use an in-memory database.
